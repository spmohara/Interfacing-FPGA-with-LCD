Designed the necessary hardware in Verilog to interface an FPGA with an LCD display. A simple message was displayed on the LCD in ASCII characters, which in this case was “Hello, Sean!”. The FPGA is able to control the LCD display via a 4-bit data interface by disabling the Intel StrataFlash memory in order to allow full read/write access to the LCD.
